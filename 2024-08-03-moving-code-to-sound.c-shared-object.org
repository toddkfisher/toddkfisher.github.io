*Prevous livestream:*

In my last livestream, I "tested" asychronous sound playback/stop using
Miniaudio's [fn:ma] low-level API.  All of this code lived in ~simple-playback.c~ which was
intended as a proof-of-concept.  Today I'll be moving code to ~sound.c~ which
compiles to a dynamically-loaded library ~libsound.so~.  Once we have a working
~libsound~ we can stress-test our sound code in Lisp.

*Warning:* this will be sleep-inducing as it's mostly copy/paste and fixing compilation errors.

*2nd Warning:* it's a lovely afternoon outside and I have my patio door open, which means
there might be some noise in the background.
